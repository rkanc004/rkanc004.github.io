**[Advance Software Testing: Test Coverage and Fault Analysis](https://github.com/Rohith12111/cs206-project-testers)**    

- Devised a Python-based fault analysis system using gcov, achieving deeper insights into code behavior and improving vulnerability identification.
- Utilized the gcov library for comprehensive code coverage analysis, refining test case prioritization and exposing 21 of 23 fault versions, resulting in enhanced test coverage and a significantly more efficient fault detection process.

**[Medicare Fraud Detection](https://github.com/Rohith12111/HealthCareFraud)**    

- Performed data joins on healthcare datasets - part D prescriber, LEIE, and payment data from CMS.gov.in, of 3GB with 1 million records, to identify fraudulent NPIs.
- Leveraged Spark SQL for advanced data query analysis to extract key insights in healthcare datasets. Applied SparkMlLib models - Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting classifier; resulted in 85% accuracy in detecting fraudulent doctors (NPIs).
